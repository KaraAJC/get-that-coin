## This challenge:

Back to basics! To be finished in Ruby or JavaScript:
(No Rails or React)
----
As a user:
- When I run your program from the command line
  - I see a prompt that says "Hello! What's your name"?
  - I enter my name
  - Then I see a prompt that says "LaToya, would you like to see your balance, make a withdraw or make a deposit?

As a user:
- if I choose "Balance"
  - I see $100

As a user:
- if I choose "Deposit",
  - I am asked how much.
  - That number is then added from a balance.
  - I am shown my balance, and the word "Goodbye, thanks for banking with #{name_of_your_bank}.

As a user:
- if I choose "Withdraw",
  - I am asked how much.
  - That number is then deducted from the balance.
  - I am shown my balance, and the word "Goodbye, thanks for banking with #{name_of_your_bank}.

If you'd like to come up with something else, that's fine.  Just make sure that it has business rules, logic rules, and command line prompts.
